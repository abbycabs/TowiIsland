On Towi Island we like to play on the beach and in the forest
But Moki threw all our things into the river
Could you help us to classify them? Items from the beach, back onto the beach. Items form the forest, back into the forest
Put the items in the opposite side of which they belong
Put the items on the side they belong
If the item has a circular background
If the item has a rectangular background
Let go
If a appears
Put it in the opposite side
Put them in the right side
Let go the first item after 
The first objet after 
let go
You did great! You've helped us a lot. Let's go back to the island!
